Accompanying code for my blog [jaokim.github.io](https://jaokim.github.io/).

## Introduction
The code here tries to mimic a relatively likely production system. The mimiced system is supposed contain a plethora of bugs, anti-patterns, oddities, performance issues and in general be less than ideal. It serves as a sandbox, or playground to demonstrate how to troubleshoot various issues.

Disclaimer: This code contains both subtle and not so subtle bugs -- that is its purpose.
